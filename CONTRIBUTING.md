# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome.

We most need help with the following:

* Porting to Linux and Mac OS. The project has been constructed so that any dependencies on Windows and its runtime have a level of abstraction between them to make this possible.
* Exporting to and running WebAssembly or other LLVM targets.
* Additions to core functionality and standard library:
  * String handling.
  * Memory management / garbage collection.
